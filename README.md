### Specification

The owner of MyFancyRetailer wishes to modernize the business by using a database to improve customer service by keeping track of inventory, suppliers, customers, customer orders and wish lists and by offering on-line ordering. You have been hired to design the retailer’s database and system that manages it and optionally the interactive front-end that offers on-line ordering. MyFancyRetailer orders its products from various suppliers. Each product can only have one supplier. MyFancyRetailer has many customers. Information about customers and their order history and wish list should be stored.  Customers should have the option of having a wish list of products and have the ability to rate products. Your job is to “mine” the database for information that would help the retailer promote the business (for instance finding products of “possible interest” to the customers). The retailer also needs to be able to find which products are selling well, which products don’t sell too well to be used in promotional offers, and which customers are active in order to rewarded them with special offers.

The retailer stocks the inventory in a warehouse. As orders are shipped and the inventory depletes the inventory should be restocked. Whenever a product’s inventory reaches reorder levels, it must be reordered from its supplier. The database should also keep track of suppliers. A customer can place an order even if the products are not in stock. A customer order will be shipped when all the products in the order are available.
